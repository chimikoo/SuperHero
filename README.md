# Collaboration Approach

When collaborating with a teammate, I would first brainstorm with them to get a second perspective on the project. We would discuss what could be added, improved, or removed. 
Once we align on the vision, we would break tasks into manageable pieces and start working on them. Having a structured plan or guideline is crucial for effective development, ensuring we stay organized and productive.

# Future Enhancements

 **If I had more time, I would:**

- Implement additional backend checks to prevent duplicate superheroes.
- Expand the frontend to allow users to click on a superhero for more details, such as their weapon, real name, and backstory.
- Add a villains section to display battles between superheroes and villains, including more detailed villain profiles.
- Improve test coverage, as I faced challenges in getting tests to run smoothly and would like to enhance my knowledge in this area.
- I would maybe try to intergate Fastify as well to get a bit more preformance.
